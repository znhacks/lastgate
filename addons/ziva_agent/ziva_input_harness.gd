# Injected-input harness for the run_scene tool, registered as the
# "ZivaPlaytestIO" autoload before the embed plays. It runs INSIDE the live
# game, so get_tree().get_root() is the real game viewport (autoload/root
# CanvasLayers included) and Input.parse_input_event is the same channel a
# player's hardware feeds.
#
# Every parameter arrives through the sidecar JSON the tool writes - nothing is
# substituted into this file - so the tool and the QA session drive one tested
# implementation, and this file ships as a normal addon asset.
#
# It runs in one of two modes, chosen by which sidecar the tool left behind:
#
# - batch (run_scene): replay the timed `inputs`, record what each press/release
#   edge actually cost in frames and ms, capture the root texture onto
#   results_path and reply "ziva_pt:captured" through the debugger.
# - session (QA session): dial plugin-server's socket and serve
#   act/observe/watch/drive/stop ops turn by turn, holding the tree paused
#   between them so the world cannot move while the caller is deciding. Probe
#   expressions come entirely from the caller; nothing here knows anything about
#   the game being played.

# frames, not render frames: game logic polls input on the fixed physics tick,
# while render frames run as fast as the machine draws - measured 165fps against

# what keeps this cheap enough to run either side of every probe. Deliberately
# knows nothing about any particular game: `_slots`, `health` and `score` are all
# just script variables here.
#
# Values are hashed, never stringified. var_to_str() on a game that keeps its
# world in a declared variable serializes that whole world every call: measured
# on Godotcraft, whose world.gd holds ~9800 voxels across four Dictionaries, one
# digest built 5.28 MB of text and took 167 ms. This runs twice per probe and
# once per frame inside an `until` wait, so that shape turned a 600-frame wait
# into 200 s of harness CPU and blew straight through the session's 120 s op
# deadline. Hashing the same values costs 6.5 ms - 26x cheaper, and strictly
# more sensitive than the text form (see the identity fold below).
# ---------------------------------------------------- what the WORLD did
#
# `effect` used to mean "did the GDScript strings the caller happened to choose
# change value". That is not what the caller reads it as: the system prompt
# turns a null result into a verdict about the GAME. Measured cost of the
# difference - a run pressed E while probing `_hud.visible`, got `effect: none`,
# and concluded the inventory was broken. It was not; the right probe was
# `is_inventory_open()`. The agent abandoned a working mechanic and paid for it.
#
# So the world is measured independently of the caller's probes. Everything here
# is derivable with NO per-game knowledge - verified against two unrelated games
# (a voxel sandbox and a golf game): the current camera and its transform, what
# that camera is looking at (a raycast through the viewport centre), the visible
# UI census, and the whole-tree digest that already exists for probe purity.
